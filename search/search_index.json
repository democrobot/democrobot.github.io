To do this, we plan to maximize the use of machine learning to develop software capable of making need for reform clear to both the general public and the people they put into power.</p> <p>By importing, processing, and analyzing all publicly available data relevant to the cause, we can build AI-powered tools designed to quickly piece together voters, districts, campaigns, elections, and legislation and find the best intersections to focus resources on. Transparency and accountability are essential to this process, and the data holds the key.</p> <p>We currently are concentrating on Pennsylvania state government, with beta testing of the platform available in early 2025.</p>"},{"location":"blog/","title":"Blog","text":""},{"location":"projects/","title":"Projects","text":""},{"location":"projects/#democracrm","title":"DemocraCRM","text":"<p>A purpose-built, collaborative CRM for grassroots pro-democracy, anti-corruption reform lobbying.</p> <p> Learn more</p>"},{"location":"projects/#legiscrapers","title":"Legiscrapers","text":"<p>Web scrapers that specialize in collecting legislative and election data that we use to analyze  and utilize for reform efforts.</p> <p> Learn more</p>"},{"location":"projects/democracrm/","title":"DemocraCRM","text":"<p>Details coming soon.
