To do this, we plan to maximize the use of machine learning to develop software capable of making need for reform clear to both the general public and the people they put into power.</p> <p>By importing, processing, and analyzing all publicly available data relevant to the cause, we can build AI-powered tools designed to quickly piece together voters, districts, campaigns, elections, and legislation and find the best intersections to focus resources on. Transparency and accountability are essential to this process, and the data holds the key.</p> <p>We currently are concentrating on Pennsylvania state government, with beta testing of the platform available in early 2025.</p>"},{"location":"blog/","title":"Blog","text":""},{"location":"blog/introducing_democrobot/","title":"Squashing Bugs and Upgrading Features in DemocracyOS","text":"<p>Our government is a set of systems, and democracy (we'll call it \"DemocracyOS\" for fun) is the operating system that runs them. Citizens provide the inputs of votes, taxes, and time into the system, which in turn elects officials who then output and oversee laws and budgets. We've obviously oversimplified the concept, but at its core, this is the primary objective.</p> <p>DemocracyOS was experimental when it started out as an Alpha release, and after several centuries of Beta testing, it's considered a stable production system. But with its growth came serious problems that we increasingly struggle with today.</p> <p>Like any operating system, there are bugs in DemocracyOS that need to be fixed. Overall, the output and quality of legislation that matches the input system of our votes and taxes is underperforming, with weak policies being produced and less bills being passed in some cases. Instead of passing quality bills, some officials are focused on controlling system resources and preventing other officials from performing their functions.</p> <p>Even worse, DemocracyOS is in danger due to vulnerabilities that threaten its continued operation. By attacking the campaign finance firewall, streams of money from big corporations, foriegn states, and billionaires have been overriding the citizens' control of the officials, distorting legislative and budget outcomes in ways a computer virus or ransomware would take control or shutdown a computer system.</p> <p>These bugs and vulernabilities must be fixed to keep DemocracyOS running and under the control of the citizens.</p>"},{"location":"projects/","title":"Projects","text":""},{"location":"projects/#democracrm","title":"DemocraCRM","text":"<p>A purpose-built, collaborative CRM for grassroots pro-democracy, anti-corruption reform lobbying.</p> <p> Learn more</p>"},{"location":"projects/#legiscrapers","title":"Legiscrapers","text":"<p>Web scrapers that specialize in collecting legislative and election data that we use to analyze  and utilize for reform efforts.</p> <p> Learn more</p>"},{"location":"projects/#lawgorithms","title":"Lawgorithms","text":"<p>A collection of ML/AI models to support data processing and analysis of legislative and election data.</p> <p> Learn more</p>"},{"location":"projects/democracrm/","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>DemocraCRM is an open source, purpose-built public affairs and advocacy platform designed for supporting grassroot efforts to pass pro-democracy, anti-corruption laws everywhere, for everyone.</p>"},{"location":"projects/democracrm/#the-purpose","title":"The Purpose","text":"<p>It's main goal is to advance reform efforts through organizing and lobbying for legislative changes. The organizing functionality centers around recruiting, engaging, and activating people in specific reform campaign activities, and the lobbying functionality centers around targeting officials and voters, performing advocacy efforts, and tracking progress on proposed legislation that meets the campaign objectives.</p> <p>DemocraCRM differs from other common activism CRMs such as NationBuilder and Action Network because it focuses specifically on practices and processes dedicated to getting legislation passed. While these other services provide excellent value for many groups, we needed a specific set of tools to do our jobs as effectively as possible and could quickly evolve with our needs.</p>"},{"location":"projects/democracrm/#the-platform","title":"The Platform","text":"<p>Many additional features are being developed to support these efforts by making the platform a collaborative place for organizations to share information and work together towards common legislative goals. Each organization will have a workspace account where its activities are performed within, and platform users can join workspaces and participate in those organizations' efforts. This is similar to Slack, for example.</p> <p>Organizations can share and collaborate on data and content together, such as on a piece legislation that is mutually beneficial to each's reform goals. They will also benefit from centralized data and services that the platform provides, freeing them up to focus on what they do best.</p>"},{"location":"projects/democracrm/#the-people","title":"The People","text":"<p>DemocraCRM is currently being developed by a team within March on Harrisburg, a Pennsylvania-based nonprofit with a mission to \"Make Corruption Illegal and Take our Democracy to Where It\u2019s Never Been.\" Our hope is to recruit allied organizations to help build this platform into something that empowers everyone working towards that same goal, in every state in the US and possibly beyond.</p> <p>If you're interested, please reach out via connect@democrobot.ai or on the GitHub project page.</p>"},{"location":"projects/lawgorithms/","title":"Lawgorithms","text":"<p>Details coming soon.
