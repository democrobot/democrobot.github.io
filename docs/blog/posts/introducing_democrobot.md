# Squashing Bugs and Upgrading Features in DemocracyOS

Our government is a set of systems, and democracy (we'll call it "DemocracyOS" for fun) is the
operating system that runs them. Citizens provide the inputs of votes, taxes, and time into the
system, which in turn elects officials who then output and oversee laws and budgets. We've
obviously oversimplified the concept, but at its core, this is the primary objective.

DemocracyOS was experimental when it started out as an Alpha release, and after several centuries of
Beta testing, it's considered a stable production system. But with its growth came serious problems that
we increasingly struggle with today.

Like any operating system, there are bugs in DemocracyOS that need to be fixed. Overall, the output and
quality of legislation that matches the input system of our votes and taxes is underperforming, with
weak policies being produced and less bills being passed in some cases. Instead of passing quality bills,
some officials are focused on controlling system resources and preventing other officials from performing
their functions.

Even worse, DemocracyOS is in danger due to vulnerabilities that threaten its continued operation. By
attacking the campaign finance firewall, streams of money from big corporations, foriegn states, and
billionaires have been overriding the citizens' control of the officials, distorting legislative and
budget outcomes in ways a computer virus or ransomware would take control or shutdown a computer system.

These bugs and vulernabilities must be fixed to keep DemocracyOS running and under the control of
the citizens.
