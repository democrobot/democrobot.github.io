# About

Welcome to the official site of Democrobot AI.

We're on a mission to empower the grassroots efforts across the U.S. and beyond to fix our broken
legislative system that puts money ahead of people, enabling corruption instead of democracy. To
do this, we plan to maximize the use of machine learning to develop software capable of making
need for reform clear to both the general public and the people they put into power.

By importing, processing, and analyzing all publicly available data relevant to the cause, we can
build AI-powered tools designed to quickly piece together voters, districts, campaigns, elections,
and legislation and find the best intersections to focus resources on. Transparency and
accountability are essential to this process, and the data holds the key.

We currently are concentrating on Pennsylvania state government, with beta testing of the platform
available in early 2025.
